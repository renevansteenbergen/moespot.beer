Used Empire Ale M15 from Mangrove Jack’s. It’s currently fermenting, did some measurements when I started the dryhop, all numbers looks good, and taste is ok, till now."

The recipes are not that detailed on the mashing and colours, but i did my best to match the grains with some common sense. The same on the mash, used a BIAB Full Body scheme. IBU ended up a bit higher than the original, but boy you can taste the hops. :) Link to the BrewDog DIY."

Germans are know for their beers, so I tried to drink as much different beers as i could, but i got stuck at a Dunkel from Flensburger Brauerei Emil Peter Lager. I’ve started looking for a good recipe and came up with this one, its does not come close but tasts good :)"

But the “trend” I’ve read, hard to get them off, lot of work, expensive, ect etc. Then I’ve seen the labels of Herma. They fit exactly on top of the cork. so no cleaning bottles :). I labeled the leftovers bottles of the IPA and the Weizen."

BeerSmith 2 told me to add 190 grams of table sugar. I took 200 ml water from the well and boiled it together with the sugar for a few min. Let it cool down and it went directly in the FastFerment.Gave it a short stir and let it rest for 2 hours."

The total volume was ±15L. I added 100 grams of sugar directly in the FastFerment after boiling it for a few min in water to dissolve. Gave it a short stir and let it rest for 2 hours. In that time I sanitised the bottles and let them dry off."
