Iâ€™ve bottled the [Weizen] today, on Saturday I had 72 bottles in the dishwasher at 70C, let them in for the night, sanitised the bottles the next morning. [BeerSmith 2] told me to add 190 grams of table sugar. I took 200 ml water from the well and boiled it together with the sugar for a few min. Let it cool down and it went directly in the [FastFerment].Gave it a short stir and let it rest for 2 hours.
