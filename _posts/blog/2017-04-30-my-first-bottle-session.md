I had my first bottle session today, it was the [IPA] I brew 2 weeks ago. Sanitised the hose, bottles, adapter of the [FastFerment] and corks. the end results was 43 bottles of 33cl. The total volume was Â±15L. I added 100 grams of sugar directly in the [FastFerment] after boiling it for a few min in water to dissolve. Gave it a short stir and let it rest for 2 hours. In that time I sanitised the bottles and let them dry off.
