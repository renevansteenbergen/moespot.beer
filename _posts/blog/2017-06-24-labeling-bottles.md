Labeling the bottles,… I’ve read some articles on how to do this, its cool to have your own designed labels on the bottles. But the “trend” I’ve read, hard to get them off, lot of work, expensive, ect etc. Then I’ve seen the labels of [Herma]. They fit exactly on top of the cork. so no cleaning bottles :). I labeled the leftovers bottles of the [IPA] and the [Weizen].
