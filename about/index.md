This is a my personal brewing page, like to blog / write about my own brews and results. Is’s **not meant to be commercial** in any kind. I’m using water from our own well, that is 40 meters deep. It’s tested in the lab and after installing a filtrations system, to get the iron out, its as clean (or cleaner) then water from the tap. The thing I like here, no chemicals are added in the water.

## Brewing equipment:

* Speidel [Braumeister 20L Plus].
* 10L mout cylinder, for smaller batches.
* 6 Gallon / 23 Litres [FastFerment].
* [The Catalyst] Fermentation System
* [Beersmith 2] brewing software
